        <h3>About Chicago</h3>
        <p>
          The City of Chicago covers an area of 60,000 hectares and sits 176
          meters (578 feet) above sea level on the southwestern shore of Lake
          Michigan. At 190 km wide and 495 km long, its the 5th largest body of
          fresh water in the world. The city is traversed by the Chicago and
          Calumet rivers. Chicago's extensive parklands, including 3,000
          hectares of city parks attract an estimated 86 million visitors
          annually. As a multicultural city that thrives on the harmony and
          diversity of its neighborhoods, Chicago today embodies the values of
          America's heartland-integrity, hard work and community and reflects
          the ideals in the social fabric of its 77 distinct neighborhoods.
          Chicago is recognized across the United States as a very passionate
          sports town. Chicago is a leader in reforming public schools,
          enhancing public safety and security initiatives, providing affordable
          housing in attractive and economically sound communities, ensuring
          accessibility for all and fostering, social, economic and
          environmental sustainability.
